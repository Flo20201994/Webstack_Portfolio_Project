Detection and Reporting
We aim to remove content or accounts that violate our rules. Content first goes through a routine review process by the ALX SE Staff.

👉🏾 If content is identified as a potential violation of the Community Guidelines, it will be removed, or flagged for additional review by our moderators.

Although the ALX SE Team works hard to enforce our community guidelines, we cannot guarantee that all content shared complies with our guidelines.

👉🏾 Suspected violations can be reported by the ALX SE Community by tagging @ALXSEcommunity in the thread of the post you want to report, or by sending a direct message to an ALX Staff Member with detailed descriptions and necessary screenshots.

We highly encourage you to report if you discover any content or accounts that violate our community guidelines

👉🏾 Please let us know so we can review and take appropriate action to keep the ALX SE Community a safe and inclusive space for everyone.

 

Reporting Methods:
Tag @ALXSEcommunity in the thread of the post you want to report.
For delicate issues (e.g., private harassment), send a DM to a staff member with detailed descriptions and necessary screenshots, if possible.
Please also: use Discord’s reporting mechanism for SPAM, harassment, abuse, harmful misinformation, glorifying violence, or exposing private information. This feature is independent of ALX SE staff control.
 

For Ensuring Fairness in Our Enforcement Actions
Moderating communications and interactions in the ALX SE Community is a complex effort and developing a trusted process by the ALX SE Community is important.

We are committed to being impartial and evidence-based, producing fair outcomes, giving notice of enforcement actions, and providing an opportunity to appeal.

Notice and Appeals
To ensure fairness, we work towards providing notifications if you have violated our rules and guidelines.

If you have posted content that we do not allow, we will notify you via email and share the reason for the removal.

First offence
You will receive an email warning and there will also be an immediate temporary suspension of your account on Discord. The suspension will be lifted when an apology is issued to the parties involved and you send information or evidence of your apology to the ALX SE Staff at softwareengineering@alx.app.
Second offence
On second violation, you will receive another email warning and there will be permanent suspension of your account on Discord.
Third offence
On third violation, you will receive an email and will be dismissed from the ALX SE program.


🔴 Letters of Recommendations for Graduates with reported offences 🔴
As ALX SE strives to maintain high program standards and aims to promote respect within the ALX SE Community and beyond, any request for a letter of recommendations from the ALX SE Program Staff will highlight your performance and moral conduct as a learner.

In keeping with our aim to ensure fairness, we will keep records of all offences by recording them in an Offence Registry. Should you request a letter of recommendation from ALX, the said letter will include records of your offences.

 

Contacting ALX SE For Appeals
Content that violates our community guidelines will be removed. If you believe that your content was incorrectly removed, let us know by submitting an appeal. Your feedback helps us to improve the ways we keep the ALX SE Community safe.

If your account has been banned, you will not be able to log in to your Discord account.

If you believe that your account was banned incorrectly, let us know by submitting an appeal.

 

To submit an appeal
