Portfolio Project Review: Introducing Automated Project Review System

Automated Project Review (APR) System
Welcome to the APR System, a new initiative to streamline and improve the review process for the portfolio projects. APR is designed to ensure that all learners receive standardized, efficient, and constructive feedback to enhance their projects and support their journey toward graduation.

Why Are We Introducing APR?
APR will allow us to manage the growing number of project submissions effectively, ensuring that each learner gets high-quality feedback while also maintaining the integrity of our program standards. This system will enable us to scale reviews and deliver timely feedback that helps learners journey.

How APR Works & Process Flow
Portfolio Project Completion:
The project should be completed and submitted for review. Ideally first and second deadlines.
Learner Submission:
Once your project is complete, upload a video demo link of your app along with any additional resources via the designated form(Link to the form will be provided). Here are the required links:
Video Demo link

Review Link

Mentor Review:
Mentors will review your submission, assessing the project according to the provided criteria.
Score & Feedback:
Within 48 to 72 hours of submission, you’ll receive an email notification informing you that your project has been reviewed, along with a score posted on your Intranet profile.
Random One-on-One Calls (If Needed):
Based on the review, mentors may invite you to a one-on-one session for more personalized feedback. Mentors may schedule a project defense call if there are any doubts about the originality of your work. You may be required to defend your project live.
Score & Intranet Update:
All scores are updated on your Intranet profile for easy access.
Quality of the Demo Video

The demo video should be short, concise, and clearly showcase all MVP (Minimum Viable Product) core features. A well-organized demo helps mentors quickly understand your project’s functionality and impact, leading to more effective feedback. It should entail the following:

An overview of the project,
Technologies used,
Roles of each team member (if applicable),
A live demonstration of the project in action.
APR Feedback Report

Mentors will provide specific feedback in each key area to help you grow. Remember, constructive feedback is a valuable tool for improvement. We hope that you will employ these insights to enhance your future projects and reach new heights in your development journey. To see the feedback, refer to the QA Review button on your presentation project.
